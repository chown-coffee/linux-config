You can use the following commands to “initilize” the fans so the fancontrol can read them.

$ sudo modprobe dell-smm-hwmon ignore_dmi=1

$ sudo sensors-detect

After that is done you should be able to setup a fancontrol config with

$ sudo pwmconfig

After it is set up you can launch fancontrol to control the fans

$ sudo fancontrol

If you want to tweak the setting, modify the fancontrol config under

/etc/fancontrol

or run $(pwmconfig) again and replace config.

Sounds like you should be able to add the following to “etc/modprobe.d/dell.conf” to get it to run on boot.

options dell-smm-hwmon ignore_dmi=1
